    'The secret of Monkey Island',
    'The Secret of Monkey Island is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist Guybrush Threepwood through the game''s world and interacts with the environment by selecting from twelve verb commands (nine in newer versions) such as "talk to" for communicating with characters and "pick up" for collecting items between commands and the world''s objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game. While conversing with other characters, the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed in a dialog tree; the game is one of the first to incorporate such a system. The in-game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes. Like other LucasArts adventure games, The Secret of Monkey Island features a design philosophy that makes the player character''s death nearly impossible (Guybrush does drown if he stays underwater for more than ten minutes)',

    'Monkey Island 2_ LeChuck''s Revenge: The secret of Monkey Island',
    'LeChuck''s Revenge plays like most SCUMM-based point-and-click adventure games. Actions and dialogues are depicted on an Animation Window which covers the top of the screen; verbal commands are listed in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, while Inventory items are shown as icons on the lower right-hand corner. A Sentence Line is located below the Animation Window and serves in describing the actions of the player. The game was one of the few adventure games that offered the player a choice in levels of puzzle difficulty. In some versions, before starting the game, the player is prompted to choose between regular version and "Monkey 2 Lite", a relatively stripped-down experience that bypasses many puzzles entirely. On the back of the game''s packaging it is (jokingly) stated that this mode is intended for video-game reviewers',

    'The Curse of Monkey Island',
    'The Curse of Monkey Island is a point-and-click adventure game. The SCUMM engine used to create the interface in the previous Monkey Island games was also used for this installment, but the verb command and inventory menus which previously took up the lower portion of the screen are replaced by a pop-up action menu and inventory chest, allowing the game''s scenes to occupy the entire screen. This was modeled on a similar system used for 1995''s Full Throttle.
The player controls Guybrush''s actions using a computer mouse and optional keyboard shortcuts. An on-screen cursor changes color to indicate objects or people with which Guybrush may interact. The player can then bring up the action menu, which resembles a gold coin and has three icons: a hand, a skull, and a parrot, respectively corresponding to actions related to the hands, eyes and mouth. The hand typically corresponds to physical actions such as picking something up, using an item, or operating a mechanism; the skull is usually used to look at something; and the parrot to talk to someone or eat something. Alternatively, clicking the right mouse button acts as shortcut to perform the most obvious action; right clicking on a person, for example, will cause Guybrush to talk to them.
The player can also bring up their inventory, which appears as an open chest taking up most of the screen and containing all of the items which Guybrush has collected. By clicking and dragging items around the screen, the player can attempt to use them with other objects in the inventory (for example, combining a diamond with an engagement band to make a diamond ring), or with objects or people in the current scene.
At the start of the game, the player may choose between two difficulty levels: a normal mode, or a "Mega-Monkey" mode with more puzzles to solve. Similarly, during the game''s third chapter, a choice is offered to either have Guybrush''s crew assist with ship-to-ship sea combat, or for the player to have full control during these battles',

    'Escape from Monkey Island',
    'Escape from Monkey Island is an adventure game that consists of dialogue with characters and solving puzzles. The game is controlled entirely with the keyboard or alternatively with a joystick, making it the only non-point-and-click game in the Monkey Island series.
A feature of the game are action-lines: Guybrush will glance at any items that can be interacted with; the player can use ''Page Up'' or ''Page Down'' to select the item that he wants Guybrush to look at.
One of the hallmark aspects of the Monkey Island games, the insult swordfighting — the sword duels which were won by knowing the appropriate insults and responses — is briefly touched upon in the game as "insult armwrestling", and in an unwinnable insult duel against Ozzie Mandrill. In the second part of the game, the insult games are replaced by "Monkey Kombat", the name being a parody of Mortal Kombat with a symbol to match. Monkey Kombat is a sub-game akin to rock-paper-scissors, where the player needs to memorize lines of "monkey insults and retorts" which consist of per-game randomized compositions of "monkey words" like "oop", "chee", "ack" and "eek".',

    'Tales of Monkey Island',
    'Like its predecessors, Tales of Monkey Island is a graphic adventure game; the player assumes the role of the protagonist in an interactive story, which is driven by the exploration of the game''s three-dimensional (3D) environments and by solving puzzles. These puzzles are traditional adventure game conundrums that require the player to use the environment, or items that have been found and stored inside the game''s inventory, to accomplish goals. In keeping with previous Monkey Island games, Tales of Monkey Island allows players to combine certain items to create new items; for instance, the player can combine a number of voodoo ingredients with a cutlass to produce a magical cutlass.
The game world is explored with a PC keyboard and mouse, or the Wii Nunchuk''s analog stick. Contrary to previous Telltale adventure games, the player holds and drags the mouse to move Guybrush, rather than point and clicking. The WASD keys or the arrow keys may instead be used to move Guybrush. Like other Monkey Island games, Tales of Monkey Island is designed to prevent the player from meeting a dead-end, such as the death of the player character. Each of the game''s chapters is an estimated two to four hours in length, depending on the player''s ability to solve the puzzles. A hint system can assist struggling players.
The first chapter of the game includes a "treasure hunt" mode, where the player directs Guybrush through a maze-like jungle in pursuit of hidden treasure. Found treasures translate into prizes and discounts on Telltale''s website. To access this mode, the player must locate maps on the Internet, hidden on the official Telltale website and three participating Monkey Island fansites',

    'Return to Monkey Island',
    'Return to Monkey Island is a 2D point-and-click adventure game. The objective is to move the story forward by solving narrative-based puzzles. This can be done by exploring locations, talking to non-player characters to acquire information, collecting items and using them at the right time. The player controls the pirate Guybrush Threepwood, who sails the seas and visits islands.
The user interface is different from previous 2D Monkey Island games. Tooltips over screen hotspots guide the player''s actions: when the cursor is moved over an interactive zone of the scene, a brief phrase appears, suggesting what action Guybrush will take. The inventory uses a drag and drop interface to easily use and combine items and the interface has been designed to work with controllers or mice.
The game includes a hint system designed to discourage players from looking for walkthroughs online and make sense "in the fantasy" of the game. The game also includes a simplified mode called "casual mode" for less experienced players.',

    'Street Fighter II',
    'Street Fighter II follows several conventions and rules established by its 1987 predecessor Street Fighter. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent''s vitality before the timer runs out. Both fighters having equal vitality left yields a "double KO" or "draw game" and additional rounds ensue until sudden death.
In the first Street Fighter II, a match can last up to ten rounds; this was reduced to four rounds since Champion Edition. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match. After every third match in the single-player mode, a bonus stage gives additional points including a car-breaking stage, a barrel breaking stage, and a drum-breaking stage. Between the matches, the next match location is selected on a world map.
Playing Street Fighter II on an arcade machine
Like in Street Fighter, the controls are an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The joystick can jump, crouch, walk left and right, and block. A tradeoff of strength and speed are given by three punch buttons and three kick buttons, each of light, medium, and heavy. The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including new grabbing and throwing attacks. Special moves are performed by combinations of directional and button-based commands.
Street Fighter II differs from its predecessor due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with distinct fighting styles and special moves including combos. According to IGN, "the concept of combinations, linked attacks that can''t be blocked when they''re timed correctly, came about more or less by accident. Street Fighter II''s designers didn''t quite mean for it to happen, but players of the original game eventually found out that certain moves naturally flowed into other ones." This combo system was later adopted as a standard feature of fighting games and was expanded upon in this series.',
